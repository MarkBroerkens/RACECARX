        "excerpt":"This tutorial is based on      JetPack 4.3   ROS Melodic   Install JetPack 4.3     Download and install NVIDIA SDK Manager   Note: Select the manual installation mode.  Automatic mode might have issues when starting up in headless mode. See bug 200525134 in the L4T Release Notes   Notes   During first boot I configured racecarx as hostname and   added a user called mark   Enable password-less login via ssh  In order to be able to login via ssh into the racecarx without typing your password, you can create a pair of private / public ssh keys and upload the public key in the ~/.ssh/autorized_keys on the racecarx.   Create the ssh keys   ssh-keygen   upload the public key to racecarx   ssh-copy-id mark@racecarx   Now you schould be able to login without password by typing   ssh mark@racecarx   Extend disk memory  Install M.2 NVMe SSD  JetsonHacks provides a good description for installing the SSD on the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier.   Mount SSD  We mount the partition on the SSD via UUID in order to be robust with respect to potentially changing device identifiers. Especially important if you are using USB devices.   # create the mount point sudo mkdir /XavierSSD500  # find UUID of an ext4 partition on SSD.  # you can search for the label. E.g. label=\"XavierSSD500\" sudo blkid  # backup the original fstab file that sudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.orig  # add mount information to ssd partition into fstab sudo vim /etc/fstab  # :i (switch to insert mode) # insert UUID=&lt;yout uuid is identified above&gt;  /XavierSSD500 ext4 nosuid,nodev,auto,nouser 0 2 # &lt;ESC&gt; # :wq (write and quit)  # mount the ssd according to new data in fstab sudo mount /XavierSSD500   Move /home to SSD  # create the new home folder on the SSD sudo mkdir /XavierSSD500/home # copy the home folder to the ssd preserving symlinks, permissions, access rights, ... sudo rsync -aXS /home/. /XavierSSD500/home/. sudo mv /home /home.orig; sudo ln -s /XavierSSD500/home /home sudo diff -qr /home /home.orig # diff quietly and move into subfolders    Reboot. If everything works:   sudo rm -rf /home.orig   Move docker data directory to SSD     Stop the docker daemon   sudo service docker stop      Edit configuration file /etc/docker/daemon.json to tell the docker daemon what is the location of the data directory. The content should look like:   {     \"runtimes\": {         \"nvidia\": {             \"path\": \"nvidia-container-runtime\",             \"runtimeArgs\": []         }     },     \"graph\": \"/XavierSSD500/var/lib/docker\" }      Copy the current data directory to the new one   sudo rsync -aP /var/lib/docker/ /XavierSSD500/var/lib/docker      Rename the old docker directory   sudo mv /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker.old   This is just a sanity check to see that everything is ok and docker daemon will effectively use the new location for its data.      Restart the docker daemon   sudo service docker start      Test   sudo docker run hello-world  This should download and run the hello-world container. Docker should have created several files in /XavierSSD500/var/lib/docker   If everything worked as expected you can delete the old docker folder /var/lib/docker.old. This is only required in case docker was used before and the folder existed.   Add Wifi / Bluetooth  Install Wifi/Bluetooth M.2 module  TODO: HW installation of intel 8265 M.2 module   Enable wifi  JetPack 4.3 should detect the intel 8265 M.2 wifi module out of the box.
